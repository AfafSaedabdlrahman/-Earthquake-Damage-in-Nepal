In this project, you'll work with data from Open Data Nepal to build a model to predict building damage from the Nepal 2015 Earthquake. You'll work primarily with data from the Gorkha district, with additional examples from Ramechhap. _

Some of the things you'll learn in this project are:
* How to get data by querying a SQL database.
* How to build a logistic regression model for classification.
* How to build a decision tree model for classification.
* How to incorporate ethical considerations into your model building.
